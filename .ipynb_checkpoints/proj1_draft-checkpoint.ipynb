Nonetheless, despite numerous intervention efforts made by the government and the private sector, the extent of the problem has remained pervasive and convoluted to this day.\n",

The information have been made available by the California Department of Education. The main goal for this assignment is to understand the relationship between demographics and education. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this, and provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Lynbrook High School is a comprehensive public high school serving approximately 1,820 students, grades 9-12, in suburban West San Jose. Opened in 1965 and named for the neighborhood in which it is located, Lynbrook was the fifth school in the Fremont Union High School District and one of three schools the district established during the 1960s. Beginning in the 1970s (not long after Lynbrook opened its doors), FUHSD graduates were instrumental in developing computer technologies that transformed the region into what we now know as the Silicon Valley. Lynbrook’s history is thus closely connected to some of the most profound social and technological developments of our time.\""
