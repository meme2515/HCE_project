# HCE Data 100 Curriculum Dev (Project 1)

Project 1 (Spring 2019) is a potential point of intervention where we can introduce a dataset from the Data Engineers. The current project uses a dataset containing all of the restaurants in the San Francisco/Bay Area, where students familiarize themselves with basic Pandas commands. Replacing this dataset with one that can allow for HCE tools and questions to be posed can allow for this project to enable students to learn how to use Pandas while emphasizing the context and meaning of the dataset being used. 

## ðŸ’» Project Goal

The aim of this potential Data 100 project is to familiarize students with basic Pandas commands while emphasizing the context and meaning of the dataset of interest. While the priority of the project should be placed in educating students of the relevant technical skills, the team also hopes to use this opportunity to educate students of the pressing issue of racial differences in educational outcome in the state of California, a topic relevant to nearly all students going through this core, upper-division data analytics project at Cal. The project also goes in line with Chancellor Carol T. Christ's Diversity Initiatives and the on-going national debate regarding the legitimacy of affirmative action on college campuses.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Outline

### School Directory & ACT Scores

The original project explores two datasets, restaurants and inspections, that the course developers have used to teach students to work with data at different levels of granularity. In order to deliver a similar level of complexity, the team has joined the school directory data with average ACT Scores data. The resulting table has granularity at the individual school level, and the table corresponds to the restaurants table in the original project.

### Demographics

The demographics table is organized so that each row corresponds to a given ethnicity and gender (ex. male Hispanic, female White). Although ACT Scores and Inspection Scores share similar data characteristics, the ACT Scores table has identical granularity as the school directory table. The demographics table was therefore chosen as a second table that replaces the inspections table in the original project.

### Question 8

Question 8 of the project is composed of (three) free response questions intended to motivate students to think about the context and background of the data they're dealing with. They are given the opportunity to answer questions like why are they seeing the differences that they have observed in the data and what are some interventions that that they can think of to remedy this situation. This way, we expect students to learn the implications of analyzing real world data and how data science should be combined with human context for accurate interpretation of the data.
