# HCE_project

Project 1 (Spring 2019) is a potential point of intervention where we can introduce a dataset from the Data Engineers. The current project uses a dataset containing all of the restaurants in the San Francisco/Bay Area, where students familiarize themselves with basic Pandas commands. Replacing this dataset with one that can allow for HCE tools and questions to be posed can allow for this project to enable students to learn how to use Pandas while emphasizing the context and meaning of the dataset being used.
