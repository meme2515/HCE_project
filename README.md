# HCE_project

In this project, you will investigate data regarding student demographics and educational attainment for public schools in the state of California. The information have been made available by the California Department of Education. The main goal for this assignment is to understand the relationship between demographics and education. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this, and provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.

## ðŸ“š Goals

Project 1 (Spring 2019) is a potential point of intervention where we can introduce a dataset from the Data Engineers. The current project uses a dataset containing all of the restaurants in the San Francisco/Bay Area, where students familiarize themselves with basic Pandas commands. Replacing this dataset with one that can allow for HCE tools and questions to be posed can allow for this project to enable students to learn how to use Pandas while emphasizing the context and meaning of the dataset being used.
