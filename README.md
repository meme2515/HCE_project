# HCE_project

In this project, you will investigate data regarding student demographics and educational attainment for public schools in the state of California. The information have been made available by the California Department of Education. The main goal for this assignment is to understand the relationship between demographics and education. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this, and provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.

As we clean and explore these data, you will gain practice with reading simple csv files, working with data at different levels of granularity, identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc., applying probability sampling techniques and exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables.
