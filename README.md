# HCE Data 100 Curriculum Dev (Project 1)

Project 1 (Spring 2019) is a potential point of intervention where we can introduce a dataset from the Data Engineers. The current project uses a dataset containing all of the restaurants in the San Francisco/Bay Area, where students familiarize themselves with basic Pandas commands. Replacing this dataset with one that can allow for HCE tools and questions to be posed can allow for this project to enable students to learn how to use Pandas while emphasizing the context and meaning of the dataset being used. 

## ðŸ’» Project Goal

"In fact, the U.S. educational system is one of the most unequal in the industrialized world, and students routinely receive dramatically different learning opportunities based on their social status. In contrast to European and Asian nations that fund schools centrally and equally, the wealthiest 10 percent of U.S. school districts spend nearly 10 times more than the poorest 10 percent, and spending ratios of 3 to 1 are common within states. Despite stark differences in funding, teacher quality, curriculum, and class sizes, the prevailing view is that if students do not achieve, it is their own fault. If we are ever to get beyond the problem of the color line, we must confront and address these inequalities." - Brookings Institute

The aim of this potential Data 100 project is to familiarize students with basic Pandas commands while emphasizing the context and meaning of the dataset of interest. While the priority of the project should be placed in educating students of the relevant technical skills, the team also hopes to use this opportunity to educate students of the pressing issue of racial differences in educational outcome in the state of California, a topic relevant to nearly all students going through this core, upper-division data analytics project at Cal. The project also goes in line with Chancellor Carol T. Christ's Diversity Initiatives and the on-going national debate regarding the legitimacy of affirmative action on college campuses.
