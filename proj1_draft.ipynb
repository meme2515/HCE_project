    "In recent years, the positively correlated and multifaceted relationship between educational attainment and a given person's race in the United States has been emphasized as one of the main causes of racial income gap and generational poverty. Nonetheless, despite numerous intervention efforts made by the government and the private sector, the extent of the problem has remained pervasive and convoluted to this day.\n",

The information have been made available by the California Department of Education. The main goal for this assignment is to understand the relationship between demographics and education. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this, and provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",
