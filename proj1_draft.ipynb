Nonetheless, despite numerous intervention efforts made by the government and the private sector, the extent of the problem has remained pervasive and convoluted to this day.\n",

Above is a map depicting shares of students eligible for Free and Reduced-Price Meal (FRPM) in California. The information have been made available by the California Department of Education. The main goal for this assignment is to understand the relationship between wealth and education. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this, and provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",
